  <Name>Scale Up</Name>
  <Description>Increases output of later modules to match their costs. This results in less need to spread out, and building up your colonies becoming more viable:

I didn't like how the output of some tier2/3 buildings scaled compared to their predecessors:
I weighted the costs of the consumed resources as the selling cost and assumed a value of 4.5 for volatiles and water.
I further assumed that each higher tier should improve efficency by 25%.

Calculations done here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kbdrbn9GRRSzWrncp68BoGihnSmEwzVs-3IEFvHB610

Resulting in the following changes:

Research Universities: 200-&gt;420

Fission Reactor: 42-&gt;46
Fission Reactor Farm: 125-&gt;180

Fusion Array: 85-&gt;100
Fusion Farm: 250-&gt;360
Heavy Fusion Farm: 450-&gt;1100 !

Atomsmasher 0.01 -&gt; 0.023 (only module that got adjusted in the base tier)

Removed MC costs from all but the colony main building(e.g. Mining installation and research universities).

Increased the mining output modifier to be on par with alien mining buildings:
Settlement Mining: 1.5 -&gt; 2
Colony Mining: 2-&gt;4

Increased MC generation of:
Operations Center: 1-&gt;2
Control Center: 2-&gt;4
