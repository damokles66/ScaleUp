Small mod for Terra Invicta

Increases output of later modules to match their costs. This results in less need to spread out, and building up your colonies becoming more viable:

I didn't like how the output of some tier2/3 buildings scaled compared to their predecessors:
I weighted the costs of the consumed resources as the selling cost and assumed a value of 4.5 for volatiles and water.
I further assumed that each higher tier should improve efficency by 25%.


Resulting in the following changes: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10en4giieOc6T7G-VoKy2wcYk13Y6sX2AdGZ9KWtWWac

Some examples:

Research Universities: 200->260

Fission Reactor Array: 85 -> 170
Fission Reactor Farm: 250 -> 570

NanoFactoring Complex: 300 -> 480


Removed MC costs from all but the colony main building(e.g. Mining installation and research universities).

Increased the mining output modifier to be on par with alien mining buildings:
Settlement Mining: 1.5 -> 2
Colony Mining: 2->4

Increased MC generation of:
Operations Center: 1->2
Control Center: 2->4
